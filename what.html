      From the moment the B3 organ and Kristin Plater’s knock-you-on-your-butt voice kick out of the speakers at the top of the first track, you’re enraptured. By the time 24 closes, you’re ready to hit repeat. The masterful singing and hooky, infectious melodies on this record are absolutely undeniable.

      Kristin Plater’s newest platter is one of the best I have heard this year. “Wonder Woman” has meaningful lyrics that deserve to be heard. Plater is too talented to ignore.

      “Dancing Stars” cuts loose with as big, brassy, and ballsy a post-blues rock tune as anyone I’ve heard lately. Loaded with Hammond B-3, swooning guitar, and Plater’s huge, gorgeous voice. It wows.

      Kristin Plater has made the kind of album that never wears you out. She sings with enough emotion to make you feel as if you are living through her visions of complicated love and character study. Musically, 24 provides enough variety to keep one wondering what is around the next corner.

      Plater exudes a vibrant presence on 24. There are no throwaway songs to fast-forward past. Kristin Plater could clearly carry the show through her vocal abilities alone, but she is also blessed with a knack for songwriting and storytelling.

      Kristin’s soulful brand of songwriting is similar to Natalie Merchant, Sheryl Crow, and Sarah McLachlan. Kristin’s music sounds fresh and real — a feeling person singing about life and love, not just trying to sell a CD.
